# TypeScript is Like C#

See: https://typescript-is-like-csharp.chrlschn.dev

This repository publishes a set of docs that is aimed at helping teams that are evaluating options beyond TypeScript.  (Or alternatively, if you are a C# developer trying to map concepts to JavaScript/TypeScript).

Many teams may find themselves in this position after dealing with TypeScript issues and the reality that the underlying runtime is still JavaScript and all that implies.

Particularly on the backend, the dynamic type system of JS (and therefore, TS) can be a bane when it comes to ensuring data quality and system correctness.

JavaScript's single-threaded nature also means that it can feel limiting for both runtime throughput and the possible tools developers can use to solve performance sensitive problems.

Check out the published docs ***and please leave feedback***!

## Guidelines

- No trashing either language; we're focused on educating
- Write clear, concise, and easy to follow examples
- Try to distill the examples down to the simplest use case that demonstrates the idea
- Write both TS and C# except for cases where it's focused on a C# specific language feature
- Use [VitePress markdown extensions](https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown) where appropriate including code line highlighting
