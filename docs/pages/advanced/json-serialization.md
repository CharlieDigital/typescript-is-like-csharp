# JSON Serialization

In both C# and JavaScript, **JSON serialization** is the process of converting objects into JSON strings for storage, transmission, or APIs. Both languages offer built-in mechanisms for handling this, but with significant differences in type safety, performance, and functionality. In JavaScript, the `JSON` object provides the `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` methods for serializing and deserializing data. While this is simple and works for most use cases, JavaScript's dynamic typing means there’s no compile-time checking of the object structure, and serialization can sometimes lead to runtime errors if the data doesn’t match the expected format.

In contrast, C# offers more **type safety** with its built-in `System.Text.Json` library (introduced in .NET Core 3.0) for **JSON serialization**. This library provides a fast and efficient way to serialize and deserialize objects to and from JSON, with support for strong typing, object-to-object mappings, and handling complex types like collections or custom objects. C# also offers robust support for **custom converters** if more control is needed over how specific types are serialized or deserialized. Additionally, C#'s type system allows compile-time checks to ensure that the serialized data matches the expected object structure, greatly reducing the risk of runtime errors.
