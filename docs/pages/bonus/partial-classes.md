# Partial Classes and Functions

**Partial classes** and **partial methods** in C# offer a way to split the definition of a class or method across multiple files, making it easier to organize and manage large codebases. A **partial class** allows a single class to be divided into multiple parts, potentially in different files, which can help keep large classes manageable and improve code readability. This is especially useful in large projects where multiple developers work on different aspects of a class, such as when implementing features or maintaining legacy code. The compiler merges all the partial class definitions at compile time, so they behave as a single class in the final application.

**Partial methods** work alongside partial classes and allow method declarations to be split across files, with the actual implementation optional. A partial method is defined with a `partial` keyword, and if no implementation is provided, it is ignored by the compiler, which is useful for **code generation scenarios**. For example, tools that generate code can declare partial methods, leaving the implementation to the developer or automatically inserting generated code. This enables custom extensions without modifying generated code directly, supporting scenarios where automatic code generation or scaffolding is used (e.g., in frameworks, ORM tools, or designers).

This combination of partial classes and methods provides a flexible mechanism for breaking up large codebases, supporting better organization, and enabling scenarios where code generation and manual code coexist seamlessly.
