# Switch Expressions

C# **switch expressions** (introduced in C# 8.0) provide a more concise and readable way to handle multiple conditions compared to traditional `switch-case` statements. Unlike the classic `switch`, where each case block is followed by a `break` statement, the switch expression evaluates to a value and can be used directly in assignments or return statements. This makes it ideal for cases where you need to map a value to another value or execute simple logic, all in a compact and readable format. The syntax is clean, reducing the need for boilerplate code and improving the clarity of complex decision trees.

One of the key advantages of switch expressions is **exhaustiveness checking**. The compiler can ensure that all possible cases are handled, reducing the risk of runtime errors caused by missing conditions. If a case is missing, the compiler will flag it, enforcing correctness and preventing unintended behavior. This is especially helpful when dealing with enums or discriminated unions, where each possible value must be accounted for. Additionally, switch expressions support pattern matching, allowing for more powerful and flexible condition checking, further enhancing readability and correctness in handling complex data types.
