# Extension Methods

In C#, **extension methods** allow you to add methods to existing types without modifying their original implementation. These methods are defined in static classes and must take the type being extended as the first parameter, prefixed with `this`. When used, extension methods appear as if they were part of the original type, enabling developers to extend functionality in a clean and reusable way. This is particularly useful when working with third-party libraries or system types you can't modify directly.

In JavaScript, **prototype methods** serve a similar purpose by allowing developers to add methods and properties to existing objects through their prototype. This modifies the prototype chain, making the new methods available to all instances of the object. While this provides flexibility to extend built-in objects or custom objects at runtime, it can also lead to issues like unintended side effects if the extensions aren't carefully managed, since changes affect all instances of the object globally.

Both C# extension methods and JavaScript prototype methods allow extending existing functionality without altering the original codebase, but C# offers better type safety and encapsulation, while JavaScript provides more dynamic flexibility with runtime modifications.
