# Nest.js vs Controller API

**Nest.js** builds on top of Express (or optionally Fastify) and introduces a **structured, modular architecture** with features like **decorator-based routing, dependency injection (DI), and controllers**, making it more comparable to **.NET Controller APIs** than plain Express.js. By enforcing a convention-driven approach similar to ASP.NET Core, Nest.js simplifies the development of scalable applications while integrating well with TypeScript’s strong typing. Its use of decorators for defining routes and DI for managing services closely resembles the approach used in .NET, making it feel more structured and maintainable than raw Express.

However, **Nest.js does not match .NET in performance**. Since Nest.js runs on Node.js, it inherits the limitations of JavaScript’s single-threaded event loop, leading to potential bottlenecks in CPU-bound workloads. While Fastify can improve Nest’s performance over Express, it still cannot compete with **.NET’s high-performance Kestrel server**, which is optimized for multi-threading and asynchronous processing. That said, **Nest.js is more production-ready than Express**, as it includes built-in support for **authentication, validation, middleware, and structured DI**, reducing the need for third-party dependencies.
